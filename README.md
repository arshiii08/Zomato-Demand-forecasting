# Zomato-Demand-forecasting

This repository contains a project focused on forecasting the demand for Zomato orders using historical order count data and restaurant performance metrics. The goal is to help Zomato optimize its operations by predicting future order volumes and identifying key areas for quality improvement among restaurants.

## Project Overview

The project leverages historical data to forecast future demand. It includes:
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Tracking actual order counts over time.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predicting future order trends based on historical patterns.
- **Forecast Intervals**: Providing ranges within which actual orders are likely to fall.
- **Restaurant Ratings Analysis**: Evaluating restaurant performance based on customer ratings.

## Data and Analysis

The analysis comprises two main parts:

1. **Time Series Forecasting**:  
   - The model uses historical order count data to predict future demand.
   - Forecast intervals are calculated to estimate the variability in future orders.

2. **Restaurant Quality Breakdown**:  
   - A detailed examination of restaurant ratings reveals that the majority of restaurants fall into the **Average** and **Poor** categories (over 50% of total).
   - **Very Good** and **Excellent** rated restaurants form a smaller segment, highlighting that achieving top-tier ratings is less common.
   - **Good** rated restaurants also represent a significant portion, indicating an overall positive trend but with room for improvement.
   - Visualizations such as pie charts are used to pinpoint quality gaps and suggest where Zomato could focus its quality improvement efforts, especially in the "Poor" and "Below Average" segments.


## Key Insights and Recommendations

- **Gradual Demand Increase**:  
  The forecast shows a steady rise in the number of orders over time.  
  *Recommendation*: Scale up operations by ensuring adequate restaurant and delivery partner availability.

- **Peak Day Preparedness**:  
  Forecasts indicate potential peak days when order volumes are expected to spike.  
  *Recommendation*: Schedule additional delivery personnel on these high-demand days.

- **Restaurant Quality Improvement**:  
  Restaurants in the **Good (21.97%)** and **Below Average (13.06%)** categories are prime candidates for targeted engagement to enhance their service quality and ratings.
